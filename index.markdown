Hi. I'm Alex.

I'm a pre-doctoral research fellow at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, coadvised by 
[Prof. Rebecca Diamond]() and
[Prof. Guido Imbens](). 

Before this, I completed my undergraduate education at Arizona State University, where I
was studied Mathematics and Economics. I also interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
at during that time.

I'm broadly interested in econometric theory and its application to
the fields of labor, public, and financial economics.
