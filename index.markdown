Hi. I'm Alex.

I'm a PhD student at Stanford Graduate School of Business studying economics.

Before that, I was pre-doctoral research fellow at Stanford Graduate School of Business, 
coadvised by 
[Prof. Rebecca Diamond](https://www.rebecca-diamond.com/) and
[Prof. Guido Imbens](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/guido-w-imbens/).
I'm also lucky to have been advised by
[Prof. Juan Carlos Su√°rez Serrato](https://www.jcsuarez.com/).

I'm broadly interested in econometric theory and its application to the fields of labor, and public economics.
