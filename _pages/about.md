I'm currently at the [Stanford GSB](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/research-fellows). I work on economic research with my mentors [Rebecca Diamond](https://www.rebecca-diamond.com/) and and [Juan Carlos Su√°rez Serrato](https://www.jcsuarez.com/). 

I'm also affiliated with the [Cities, Housing, and Society Lab](https://chslab.stanford.edu/faculty-researchers) at the GSB. 

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Arizona State University where I studied mathematics and economics. ASU wrote this [profile](https://news.asu.edu/20220503-asu-grad-attributes-success-scholarship-funding) following graduation, and some of my work with the Gammage Scholars was featured in the [undergraduate newspaper](https://www.statepress.com/article/2021/05/spcommunity-gammage-scholars-alhambra-jump-a-thon-digital-divide).
